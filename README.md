# The Absolute Universum

This article is about a concept of The Absolute Universum, that proposes a new point of view on our reality, universe, being. It is knowable through a set of facts about it.

*The meaning of the word universum should be understood as “the totality of everything” in the context of this article

# Manifest

Further I will use word "Universum" to mark The Absolute Universum object. Also, I will use word "researcher" to mark a subject, subjective reality; I will use the plural in relation to subjective reality conditionally and in parentheses, based on the assumption that in addition to the subjective reality of the researcher of this article, there are other subjective realities of other individuals (see my Cogito ergo sum article).

We do not use verb "exist" for this so as everything, literally, exist "inside" Universum. Word "exist" can't be applied for representing presence of Universum, instead verb "is" can be used as most suitable verb in English, so as "existance" is a characteristics of objects inside Universum. So we talk about presence of Universum rather than its existance.

"The absolute universum is present." - axiom

It presupposes the presence of an environment that is "external" to the researcher.

Following the concept of the absolute universum, our spacetime based material universum (Universe) is only one of the possible universums existing "inside" Universum.

Has a characteristic of limitlessness above like spacetime limits, so according to this characteristic can include subjective reality(ies) of researcher(s).

I daresay that some researchers may find this concept similar to the concept of God.  Based on the anthropomorphism of the concept of God, it is not entirely suitable; the concept of the supernatural as a phenomenon, the study of which involves mental going beyond the boundaries of our universum - our Universe, is better suited here, and it is only appropriate if you simply want to associate a given concept with some more familiar concept.

Below, I present you a fact map that describes Universum for it to become knowable for you. 

# Fact Map

*Fact map implies additions as I reflect and collect facts about Universum.

*The word "inside" is used in a figurative sense, for ease of imagination.

- "our" reality that we call objective reality, so as subjective reality(ies) and other possible realities, exist inside Universum. 

- Universum contains literally everything.

- contains our spacetime universum (our reality) and everything that is aside of it (assumption)

- imaginable as "space" for everything. 

- not limited of spacetime basement/nature. 

- those, "inside" of what, existance is possible (see thesis of Manifest about presence of Universum)

- has characteristic of limitlessness above like spacetime limits. 

- Universum includes all objects that cannot be known empirically. 

- its nature is not physical, in the sense of possessing its own laws and including at least one material universum (e.g. Universe). 

- is a whole that is speculatively divisible into parts, but is not part of something as a whole. 

- not represented within the limits/borders that can be imagined

- "existance" is a characteristic that is applied to objects "inside" Universum, when verb "exist" is not applicable to Universum itself.

- borders of objects "inside" of Universum is where we personally define them (relativity). 

- objects "inside" Universum exist relatively to each other.

- researcher explore Universum using the qualia that arise dynamically in the process of thinking (see Assumption of Researcher-Reality Relations image)

- the presence of Universum presupposes the presence of an "externality" in relation to the researcher (including his thinking process and qualia dynamics)
